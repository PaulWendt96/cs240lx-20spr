## Trusting trust

Read the short Ken Thompson paper in this directory --- this was his
Turing award lecture (our nobel prize), where he discussed an evil,
very slippery hack he implemented on the early Unix systems.

We will write the code for this hack.  While the paper is short, and the
hack seems not that hard, when you actually have to write out the code,
you'll have to pause and think more than a little.  Is a neat example
of how circular definitions work when you build compilers.
